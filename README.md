# KGE project 2024 - Trentino Territory & Transportation
This project was developed by Nicola Mores and Marco Roccon for the Knowledge Graph Engineering course in the academic year 2024/25.

## Purpose
The objective of this project is to create an Entity Graph containing information about transportation in the Trentino Region, focussed mainly on the city of Trento. In particular it aims to extract not only data about Busses and Trains, but also regarding shared mobility alternatives (bike, scooter and car sharing), taxis, parking facilities and bike racks. In a more concise way, the informal purpose is:

”A person wants to move in an easy and efficient way through the Trentino region using
public transports and other transport services available”

## Domain
- **Domain of Interest**: Transportation services
- **Spatial domain**: Trentino region and in particular the Trento city
- **Timespan**: from September 2024 to the end of June 2025

## Data Resources
- **[OPENdata Trentino](https://dati.trentino.it/dataset)**: Open data Trentino is a platform, managed by the autonomous province of Trento, that offers an unique catalogue of reusable data and allows the search, access and download of open data about Trentino and services in its territory.
- **[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/42.09/12.56)**: OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project that provides free and editable maps of the world, also maintaining geographic data about roads, trails, railway stations, and so on. 
- **[Trentino Trasporti Website](https://www.trentinotrasporti.it/)**: Trentino Trasporti is the main public transportation service provider in the city of Trento. Their website provides information about train and bus lines.

## Knowledge Resources
- **[SCHEMA.org](https://schema.org/)**: ”Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond”.
- **[GTFS.org](https://gtfs.org/documentation/overview/)**: ”The General Transit Feed Specification, also known as GTFS, is a standardized data format that provides a structure for public transit agencies to describe the details of their services such as schedules, stops, fares, etc”

## Language Resources
- **[Universal Knowledge Core (UKC)](https://ukc.datascientia.eu/concept)**:  ”The Universal Knowledge Core (UKC) is a multilingual, high quality, large-scale, machine-readable, and diversity-aware lexical resource”.
- **[SCHEMA.org](https://schema.org/)**: Schema.org also provides information about the language layer. Each schema is provided with a brief explanation of the meaning of the concepts introduced by itself, together with a description of each of its properties.
- **[OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/)**: OpenStreetMap, through their wiki page, also provides high quality dataset at language level, offering many formalized definitions of concepts about transportation services and streets.

## Knowledge Graph
The project's output consists of a final [Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/NikoMrs/KGE-Trentino-Territory-Transportation/tree/main/Phase%205%20-%20Entity%20Definition/Graph) and the corresponding [Mapping Model](https://github.com/NikoMrs/KGE-Trentino-Territory-Transportation/tree/main/Phase%205%20-%20Entity%20Definition/Model). The KG has been evaluated following the criteria defined by the iTelos methodology, and a demonstration of its capabilities was carried out using [GraphDB](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/), which allowed querying the graph to verify its ability to answer the Competency Questions defined at the start of the project.
